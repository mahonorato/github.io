Krol  RoAn-Presentation provides a combination of mind mapping with Powerpoint- and Prezi like presentation, using automatic filtering and zooming. Stepping the presentation not only unfolds nodes, but also displays hidden details, centers the current node, executes the named filters which may be connected to each node and more. In short it supports traversing a mind map, taking over abundant clicking from the user. Besides traversing the mindmap depth first, it is possible to define scenes and scenario's for traversing in any order. The included Help file which itself is an example which can be played or stepped as well. The Help file also contains links to example maps and videos which can be downloaded.  Besides functionality for presenting, RoAn may automatically add nodes with links to all folders and files in the directory of the mind map (indexing). As a choice image files may be displayed as inline images. This functionality is more basic than in addon diView(indexfile), but more easy to use.  Installing the add-on results in a new menu Tools> RoAn-Presentation. This menu contains a submenu \"Menu\" which opens a window with presentation and edit buttons. One of the buttons will open the Help file. Once menu RoAn is used on a mind map, a little button is added to the root to open RoAn's menu with a click next time.\n")])])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);n.default=s.exports}}]);
